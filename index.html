      <div class="mostPop">
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hello:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Competition in the workplace has been increasing
          dramatically over the last couple of years. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">According to a four-year survey by Asana, 82% of
          respondents say that they have been overworked. As a result, burnout
          has increased, and staff morale has decreased. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">As if these statistics were not already bad
          enough, the day and age we live in these days has only amplified the
          issue tenfold. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Not only do we have to fight against other
          employees, but we now have to compete against technology and other
          extreme factors. With this in mind, it is no shock that employees
          are taking on an extreme workload and refusing to say no to their
          boss.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <div class="questionTitle middleFont">
          <h1>People-Pleasing Extends Beyond The Office</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="MsoNormal">But this mentality of refusing to say no extends
          well beyond the office. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">In fact, many people feel overwhelmed by their
          desire to people-please in all facets of their lives. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">You may feel the desire to people-please with
          your family, friends, and people you happen to pass on the street.
          Though wanting to please people is not inherently bad,
          people-pleasing has numerous negative effects on the people-pleaser.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">For example, it sets unrealistic standards, puts
          self-care on the back burner, decreases self-esteem, and increases
          stress and anxiety. All around, this overwhelming sense to
          people-please is dangerous to your health and others around you.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
        </p>
        <div class="questionTitle middleFont">
          <h1>Creating Healthy Boundaries Requires Self-Discipline and
            Self-Respect</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="MsoNormal"> The only way to beat people-pleasing is to have
          intense self-discipline, self-respect, and knowledge of your inner
          voice. Though these items may sound easy on paper, they are
          extremely difficult to implement, especially for the people-pleaser.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Even for those who were not people-pleasers by
          nature, having the discipline, respect, and knowledge to say no to
          people can be extremely uncomfortable and awkward. So, it is
          imperative to set strict rules for yourself and others so that you
          know how to navigate these awkward situations. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The best way to set rules for yourself and others
          is by creating healthy boundaries.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Boundaries are like invisible fences that you use to separate your
          feelings, needs, and wants from other people’s feelings, needs, and
          wants. The benefit of setting boundaries is that you will be able to
          take back your life, increase your self-esteem, and build healthier
          relationships with those around you. <br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, many people have no clue how to begin setting healthy
          boundaries. There are many misconceptions and misinformation about
          boundary setting, which makes it difficult to know how to begin if
          you've never done it before. <br>
          <br>
          In order to create and enforce effective and healthy boundaries, it
          is imperative to have the tools and skills for boundary setting.
          Like any other task, boundary setting takes practice and knowledge.
